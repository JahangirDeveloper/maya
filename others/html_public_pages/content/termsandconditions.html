We advise you to print a copy of these Booking Terms and Conditions for future reference. </em></p>

<p>By using our website, you accept these Booking terms and conditions in full.</p>

<p>Capitalized but undefined words in the following Terms and Conditions shall have the meanings credited to them in “Terms of Use” section on the Website.</p>

<p>Defined Terms</p>

<p>To make it easier for our users, we identified below the terms and their meanings in the Booking Terms and Conditions:</p>

<p><strong>"Partner(s)"</strong> indicates our selected third party providers of goods and services, who offer their goods and services for sale through our Website</p>

<p><strong>"Partner Terms and Conditions"</strong> indicates any Partner terms and conditions of sale and terms of business (including but not limited to Partner’s privacy policy, booking policy, delivery policy, health and safety policy, and returns or refund policy – when applicable)</p>

<p><strong>"e-Voucher"</strong> indicates a voucher sold by a Partner on our Website. It can be used for the purchase of Services from a particular partner selected at the time of purchasing the e-Voucher;</p>

<p><strong>"Services"</strong> indicates products, goods or services offered by a Partner to be purchased or booked on our Website</p>

<p><strong>"Customer"</strong>, <strong>"you"</strong> and <strong>"your"</strong> designates you, the buyer of any Products or Services </p>

<p><strong>"Jamaliki Gift Card"</strong> indicates the gift card issued by Jamaliki, which may be redeemed on Jamaliki to discount the purchase fees of services sold on our Website, compliant with clause VIII.</p>

<p>Introduction and relationship between you, us and third party partners</p>

<p>The Website is powered by Jamaliki International company registered in Dubai and whose registered office is at Dubai. The use of “us”, “we” or “our” for short always refers to “Jamaliki”. “You” and “your” refer to the user of our Website.</p>

<p>Jamaliki does not sell any service. Our website allows you to book and pay for a broad range of high-end beauty and spa services from a wide range of providers (our Partners). The services available for purchase or booking via Jamaliki are sold by our partners and not by us. Jamaliki is only liable for organizing and concluding your booking. We are appointed by our partners to act as their commercial agent and we shall not be held responsible anything after the booking is made. The provisions of the Services booked via our Website are the responsibility of the Partner which provides them. If you pay for Services via the Jamaliki Website, your payment will either be paid directly to the relevant Partner or will be received by us acting as commercial agent on behalf of the Partner. If we receive the payment on behalf of the relevant Partner, then our receipt of the correct payment will discharge your debt to that Partner.</p>

<p>Upon your purchase of Products or Services, the transaction will automatically create two binding legal contracts:</p>

<p>a contract between you and Jamaliki (under which Jamaliki has limited responsibilities to you in relation to the booking and payment process). That contract is made according to these Booking Terms and Conditions</p>

<p>a contract between you and the relevant Partner with regard to the provision or supply of the Products or Services that you book through our Website. That contract may include separate Partner Terms and Conditions, of which you will be notified prior to making a booking.</p>

<p>All Products and Services that are available for purchase on our Website are offered by Jamaliki on behalf of its Partners. That is to say, Jamaliki will only act as a booking agent for its Partners; it cannot be held responsible or liable to you for the actual Products or Services that are booked through the Website (including Products and Services purchased through Jamaliki Gift Vouchers).</p>

<p>We can modify the Booking Terms and Conditions as set out in clause 10. Therefore, we advise you to check the Booking Terms and Conditions every time you wish to make a transaction on our Website.</p>

<p>Orders and agreements</p>

<p>You can make your order of Products and Services on our website, through the following method:</p>

<p>make an appointment at a specific time or date with a particular Partner for  a variety of Products and Services</p>

<p>During your order process, you can check and amend any errors before submitting your Order to us. We urge you to read and check your order at each stage of the order process, before finally submitting your Order.</p>

<p>After submitting any order, we will send you an email accepting the receipt of your order. However, it does not necessarily mean that you order was accepted by our partners. We deal with your order as an offer by you to buy the services specified in your order.</p>

<p>The orders you make on our website are subject to acceptance or refusal. We are appointed as the commercial agent of the Partner to conclude bookings on its behalf and the contract between you and the Partner will only be formed once we send you a confirmation email. </p>

<p>If you wish to reschedule or cancel your appointment, you can do so through the website according to the cancellation policy. However, if you experience difficulty making such changes, please do contact us as soon as possible and we will do our best to help you.</p>

<p><strong>Services</strong></p>

<p>Our Partners are under a legal duty to provide services that are in conformity with the applicable Contract.</p>

<p>All Services offered on our website are subject to availability and the images and descriptions are for illustrative purposes only. The actual services may be different from those shown on the website. Nonetheless, we ask our partners to ensure that all information provided by them should be accurately displayed on their page, complete and not misleading in any way. However, Jamaliki cannot verify the information they provide. It will be each partner's responsibility to ensure that all of its services listed on our website are available and accurately described.</p>

<p>It is your sole responsibility to disclose any medical or health-related conditions or special needs that might affect or be affected by any services, to our partners before concluding the order. Subject to clause IX.3, if you fail to communicate such information to the applicable partner, Jamaliki or the relevant partner cannot be held responsible for any injury, loss or damages resulting from the services. </p>

<p><strong>Cancellations</strong></p>

<p>In case you wanted to cancel an order you made for a Dated Booking or an e-Voucher, the following cancellation terms apply:</p>

<p>Dated Booking:</p>

<p>If you have made a dated booking, you may cancel it, if the appointment is not due within the next 48 hours, excluding public holidays and we can offer you a full refund, unless mentioned otherwise at the time of booking. </p>

<p>If you cancel a dated booking that is due in less than 48 hours, a credit note is issued to your account to be used in Jamaliki website.</p>

<p>If you cancel a dated booking that is due in less than 24 hours, a credit note is issued to your account to be used in the same salon.</p>
